To run this application locally, you must recreate the python virtual environment


To do this:

1. Run "python -m venv ." while in the GradioApp directory
2. Run "pip install -r requirements.txt"

Once dependencies are installed, simply run "python gradiotest.py", and the app will host on your local machine.
